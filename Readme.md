# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION 
Use a dataset containing transaction data to
detect fraudulent transactions.

This project is a part of my machine learning virtual internship at **TechnoHacks Edutech**


## Dataset Information
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
